"""
Subscription Service
====================
Single source of truth for plan definitions, billing cycle calculations,
and usage alerting. Used by routers/subscription.py.

Plan hierarchy
--------------
  essential (free tier / entry)  →  pro  →  enterprise
  plan_rank(): essential=0, pro=1, enterprise=2

Billing cycle
-------------
Cycles are anchored to the account creation day-of-month.
Example: account created on the 15th → bills on the 15th every month.
The safe_billing_date() helper clamps to the last valid day for short months
(e.g., created on the 31st → Feb bills on the 28th/29th).

Usage alerts
------------
check_usage_alert() is called after every completed call (voice.py → status endpoint).
It sends a single email alert when the owner hits 80% of their monthly call limit.
The alert timestamp is persisted in owners.usage_alert_sent_at so it only fires
once per billing cycle across all backend workers/pods.
